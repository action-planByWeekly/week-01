1. What Is an if Statement?


The if statement is the most basic decision-making structure in Java.
It lets your program check a condition, and only if the condition is true, a specific block of code will run.

So the if statement gives your program the ability to think and react.

Without if, a program runs straight from top to bottom with zero intelligence.

2. Syntax (Structure)
if (condition) {
    // code to run if condition is true
}


condition must produce true or false

The {} is called a block — only runs if condition is true

If condition is false → the block is skipped completely

3. What is a Condition?

A condition is an expression that results in boolean output:

✔️ true
❌ false

Examples:

age > 18
marks >= 50
salary < 30000
isLoggedIn == true
name.equals("John")

Summary of the if Statement


It checks one condition

Runs code only when condition is true

Nothing runs if condition is false

It’s the foundation for all decision-making in programming

else Statement



1. What Is else?

The else statement is the second half of an if decision.

It tells Java:

“If the if condition is false, then run this block instead.”

Meaning:

if handles the true path

else handles the false path

Together they form a two-way decision structure

3. Why Do We Need else?

Without else, the program only knows what to do if a condition is true.
But most real situations have two possible outcomes:

4. Important Rules of else

1️⃣ else can NEVER exist without an if

2️⃣ else runs only when the if condition is false

3️⃣ else is unconditional — it always runs when if is false.
