ADVANCED INHERITANCE EXAMPLE (Explained Part by Part)

The example shows:

✔ Abstract class
✔ Constructor inheritance
✔ Method overriding
✔ Hierarchical inheritance
✔ Using super
✔ Real-world use case

⛳ Step 1: Abstract Parent Class
abstract class Employee {
    protected String name;
    protected double salary;

Explanation:

abstract class → you cannot create objects of Employee.

Used when you only want child classes to be created.

protected → accessible inside child classes.

⛳ Step 2: Constructor in Abstract Class
    public Employee(String name, double salary) {
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

Explanation:

Even though the class is abstract, it can still have a constructor.

Purpose:
✔ initialize common fields for all employees
✔ child classes must call this constructor using super()

⛳ Step 3: Abstract Method (must be implemented by children)
    public abstract void work();

Explanation:

No body → must be implemented in every child class.

Forces each employee type to define their own work behavior.

This is polymorphism + inheritance.

⛳ Step 4: Normal (Non-Abstract) Method
    public void showDetails() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", Salary: " + salary);
    }
}

Explanation:

Reusable method for all children.

Children automatically inherit this method, no need to write again.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⭐ CHILD CLASS 1 – Developer
class Developer extends Employee {
    private String programmingLanguage;

Explanation:

Developer inherits from Employee.

Gains access to:
✔ name
✔ salary
✔ showDetails()
✔ and must implement work()

🎯 Developer Constructor
    public Developer(String name, double salary, String programmingLanguage) {
        super(name, salary);  // call parent constructor
        this.programmingLanguage = programmingLanguage;
    }

Explanation:

super(name, salary) → calls Employee constructor.

Without this, Developer cannot compile.

Developer has its own field: programmingLanguage.

🎯 Developer Work Method (Overriding)
    @Override
    public void work() {
        System.out.println(name + " is coding in " + programmingLanguage);
    }
}

Explanation:

Implements the abstract method work().

Gives Developer a specific behavior.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⭐ CHILD CLASS 2 – Manager
class Manager extends Employee {
    private int teamSize;

Explanation:

Another child class of Employee.

Also inherits:
✔ name
✔ salary
✔ showDetails()
✔ work() must be implemented

🎯 Manager Constructor
    public Manager(String name, double salary, int teamSize) {
        super(name, salary);
        this.teamSize = teamSize;
    }


Same as Developer: call parent constructor with super().

Manager has its own field teamSize.

🎯 Manager Work Method
    @Override
    public void work() {
        System.out.println(name + " is managing a team of " + teamSize + " people");
    }
}


Implements abstract method.

Gives Manager a unique behavior.

⭐ MAIN CLASS (Execution)
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

Creating Developer object using Employee reference
        Employee dev = new Developer("Miyuru", 50000, "Java");


✔ Allowed because Developer is-a Employee
✔ Demonstrates polymorphism
✔ You can only access Employee methods through this reference

Creating Manager object
        Employee mgr = new Manager("Nimal", 80000, 5);


Same reason → polymorphism.

Calling inherited + overridden methods
        dev.showDetails();  // from Employee
        dev.work();         // Developer's implementation

        mgr.showDetails();  // from Employee
        mgr.work();         // Manager's implementation
    }
}

Output:
Name: Miyuru, Salary: 50000.0
Miyuru is coding in Java
Name: Nimal, Salary: 80000.0
Nimal is managing a team of 5 people
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⭐ Why This Is “Advanced” Inheritance?
✔ Uses Abstract Class

To force common structure for all employees.

✔ Uses Constructor Chaining (super())

Child classes use parent constructor.

✔ Uses Method Overriding

Each child has its own behavior.

✔ Uses Hierarchical Inheritance

Multiple children from the same parent.

✔ Uses Polymorphism

Parent reference holding child object.
