1. Interface: PaymentGateway


interface PaymentGateway {

Declares an interface named PaymentGateway.
Purpose: any payment class must implement pay() and refund().
Cannot create objects of an interface.

void pay(double amount);

Abstract method → forces subclasses to define how payment works.
No body; interface methods are public and abstract by default.

void refund(double amount);

Abstract method for refunds.
Any class implementing this interface must define it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🔹 2. Interface: Discountable

interface Discountable {

A separate interface for applying discounts.
Purpose: allows some payment classes (like CreditCardPayment) to provide discount logic.

double applyDiscount(double amount);

Abstract method → returns discounted amount.
Any class that implements Discountable must define this method.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔹 3. Class: CreditCardPayment


class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentGateway, Discountable {

Implements two interfaces: PaymentGateway + Discountable.
Must override all abstract methods from both interfaces.



@Override public void pay(double amount) { ... }

Implements payment logic for credit card.
Prints a message showing payment completed.



@Override public void refund(double amount) { ... }

Implements refund logic for credit card.


@Override public double applyDiscount(double amount) { ... }

Implements discount logic.
Here: 10% discount applied.
Demonstrates multiple behaviors via interfaces.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔹 4. Class: PayPalPayment


class PayPalPayment implements PaymentGateway {


Implements only PaymentGateway (no discounts).
Must define pay() and refund().




@Override public void pay(double amount) { ... }

Implements PayPal-specific payment logic.



@Override public void refund(double amount) { ... }

Implements PayPal-specific refund logic.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



🔹 5. Main Method


PaymentGateway pg1 = new CreditCardPayment();

Polymorphism: reference type = interface (PaymentGateway), object = concrete class.
Can call pay() and refund() methods.




Discountable d1 = new CreditCardPayment();

Polymorphism again: reference type = Discountable, object = CreditCardPayment.
Can call applyDiscount() method only.





PaymentGateway pg2 = new PayPalPayment();

Another interface reference pointing to PayPalPayment object.
Can call pay() and refund().




double discounted = d1.applyDiscount(1000);

Calls CreditCardPayment.applyDiscount() via Discountable reference.
Returns 900 (10% off).


pg1.pay(discounted);

Calls CreditCardPayment.pay() with discounted amount.

pg2.pay(500);

Calls PayPalPayment.pay() for normal amount.
Same method name → different behavior depending on object → runtime polymorphism.
