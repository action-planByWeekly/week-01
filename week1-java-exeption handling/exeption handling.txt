WHAT IS AN EXCEPTION? (REAL UNDERSTANDING)

An exception is not just an error.
It is:

A signal sent by the JVM at runtime when something happens that stops the normal flow of the program.

Think about driving a car.
You are moving normally → suddenly a tyre punctures → normal flow stops → you must handle it.

Same in Java:

You access an invalid array index → JVM stops normal execution
You divide a number by zero → JVM stops
You try to connect to database → connection fails → JVM stops
You try to read a file → file not found → JVM stops
The JVM shows this stop by throwing an exception.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2️⃣ WHY DO WE NEED EXCEPTION HANDLING?

Without exception handling:
Your program will crash when one unexpected thing happens.
You cannot predict real-world issues (disk full, internet down, wrong input).
You cannot provide user-friendly messages.
You cannot recover from issues.

Modern industry software must never crash, only fail gracefully.

Example without handling:

Program crash:
java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero


Example with handling:

Please enter a number other than zero.


Difference = professional software vs amateur software.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3️⃣ WHERE DO EXCEPTIONS HAPPEN IN REAL INDUSTRY CODE?

This is important because beginners think exceptions happen only in simple programs. No.

99% of backend code needs exception handling.
Examples:

✔ Database (Spring Boot, Hibernate)

Database down
Wrong credentials
Constraint violation
Unique key conflict

✔ File Upload / Download

File missing
File too large
Permission denied

✔ REST APIs

Invalid user input
Missing JWT token
Access denied
JSON parsing error

✔ Microservices

Service unavailable
Timeouts
Broken network

✔ Collections

IndexOutOfBoundsException
NullPointerException

✔ Threading

Deadlocks
InterruptedException

✔ Business Logic

Division by zero
Invalid data

Exception handling is everywhere in a backend job.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4️⃣ TYPES OF EXCEPTIONS 

Java has three categories:

1. Checked Exceptions

These must be handled during compile-time.
If you don’t handle → compiler error.

Why?
Because they represent predictable problems that your program MUST be ready for.

Examples:

SQLException (database issues)
IOException (file issues)
FileNotFoundException
ClassNotFoundException
InterruptedException

Real world reason:
File system failing is predictable → you must handle.

2. Unchecked Exceptions

These happen at runtime.
Compiler does NOT force you to handle.

Why?
Because they represent programming mistakes, not predictable external issues.

Examples:

NullPointerException
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
ArithmeticException
IllegalArgumentException
ClassCastException

Real world reason:
You can avoid these by writing correct code.
Compiler shouldn't force you; you should fix your logic.

3. Errors

Not exceptions.
Represent serious system failures — not handled.

Examples:

OutOfMemoryError
StackOverflowError
VirtualMachineError

Reason:
Nothing you do can fix “system ran out of memory”.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5️⃣ HOW DOES EXCEPTION HANDLING WORK? (The mechanism)

When something bad happens:

JVM creates an Exception object
JVM throws it
JVM looks for a matching catch block
If found → handle
If not found → program crashes


Optional: finally block always runs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6️⃣ try–catch — Deep Understanding


✔ try block = risky code
Code that may fail goes here.

✔ catch block = recovery code
Code that responds to the failure.

✔ finally block = must-run code
Cleanup code: closing DB connections, closing files, clearing memory.

Example:


try {
    int result = 10 / 0;  
}
catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero!");
}
finally {
    System.out.println("I run no matter what!");
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7️⃣ HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN TO USE EXCEPTION HANDLING?

This part is the most important for beginners.
Use exception handling when:

✔ 1. The operation can fail due to external factors

Examples:

Reading a file
Database calls
Network calls (REST APIs)
Parsing JSON

Reading user input

✔ 2. You want to avoid program crash
In production, never let the application crash.

✔ 3. You want to show user-friendly messages
Example: Input is wrong? → Show message, don’t crash.

✔ 4. You want to differentiate between failure types
Different catch blocks for different problems:


try {
    // risky
}
catch (FileNotFoundException e) { }
catch (IOException e) { }
catch (Exception e) { }




✔ 5. You want to create custom business-level validation

Example in Spring Boot:

if (customerName == null) {
    throw new InvalidCustomerException("Name cannot be null");
}


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8️⃣ CUSTOM EXCEPTIONS — WHY?

Built-in exceptions cannot express business rules.

Example:

“Customer not found”
“Order already cancelled”
“Insufficient account balance”
“Unauthorized access”

So we create custom exceptions:

public class CustomerNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {
    public CustomerNotFoundException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}


These are used in real backend systems.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



1. What is throw? (Very Deep Explanation)
✔ throw is used inside the method

to manually create and throw an exception object.

You, the developer, decide:
WHEN the exception should happen
WHAT type of exception
WHAT message

 Think of it like this:

throw = “I am THROWING a specific problem RIGHT NOW.”

✓ Example (Easy to Understand)

void checkAge(int age) {
    if(age < 18) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("You must be 18+ to register.");
    }
}

❗ What happens?

Condition is true
You create an exception object
You throw it immediately
Method stops

Propagates upward

✔ IMPORTANT

With throw, you MUST give an exception object:
throw new Exception("message")


Nothing else works.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2. What is throws? 

✔ throws is used in method signature

to tell the caller:

“This method may throw this exception — YOU must handle it, not me.”

✓ Example
void readFile() throws IOException {
    FileInputStream f = new FileInputStream("test.txt");
}


Meaning:
This method does NOT handle IOException
It simply informs the caller
Caller MUST put try/catch OR add throws again

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 VERY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE 

✔ throw = actually throws an exception
✔ throws = declares that the method might throw (but does NOT throw itself)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUPER-POWERFUL REAL-LIFE ANALOGY (You will never forget)

🟨 throw = You THROW a bomb

→ explosion happens immediately
→ someone must catch or it destroys everything

🟩 throws = You WARN people

“This room may contain a bomb. If you enter, be ready to handle it.”

You did not throw the bomb.
You just declared the danger.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 FULL EXAMPLE WITH BOTH throw & throws


void validate(int age) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    if(age < 18) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age must be 18 or above");
    }
}

Explanation:
✔ Method signature:
throws IllegalArgumentException


Means:

This method may throw IllegalArgumentException.
Caller must handle it.

✔ Inside the method:
throw new IllegalArgumentException(...)


Means:
I am actually throwing the exception now.
Both play different roles.

| Happens where? | Inside method body            | In method signature              |
| Needs object?  | YES → `throw new Exception()` | NO object                        |
| Stops method?  | Yes immediately               | No                               |
| Who handles?   | Caller                        | Caller                           |
