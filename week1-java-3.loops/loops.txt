1. what is loop?

A loop in Java is a control flow structure that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly, as long as a specific condition is true.

Think of it like this:

“Keep doing this task again and again — until I say stop.”

In programming, repeating tasks is extremely common.
For example:

Displaying a list of customers.
Processing records in a file.
Continuously checking a user’s input.
Counting values or calculating sums.

Without loops, you would have to copy-paste the same lines of code over and over — inefficient, error-prone, and not scalable.

2. How Loops Work


When a loop runs, the following process happens in the program’s control flow:

Initialization – Set a starting point (e.g., int i = 0).

Condition check – Before every repetition, check if a certain condition is true (e.g., i < 5).

Body execution – If condition is true → run the loop body.

Update / Increment – Adjust variables (e.g., i++).

Repeat – Go back to condition step.

Stop – When condition becomes false → exit the loop.

This process happens in stack memory, because:

Each loop iteration runs inside the same method’s stack frame.

The variables created inside the loop (like i) are stored in the stack, not heap.

3. Types of Loops in Java


| Loop Type       | When to Use                                            | Condition Checked     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| `for` loop      | When you know exactly how many times to repeat         | Before each iteration |
| `while` loop    | When you don’t know the number of repetitions          | Before each iteration |
| `do-while` loop | When you want to run the block *at least once*         | After each iteration  |
| `for-each` loop | When you want to iterate through a collection or array | Implicitly handled    |

Initialization → Condition check → Execute body → Update → Repeat → Exit


✅ Stored and executed in stack
✅ Objects inside loops → heap
✅ After method ends → garbage collector frees memory
